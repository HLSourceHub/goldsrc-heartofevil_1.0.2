						<b>Stuff you should know</b><br><br>

						If you've played the earlier episodes and don't want to go through them again, then I've
						included saved games that start you off at the beginning of each episode.<br><br>

						If you have previous versions of Heart of Evil installed, <b>please delete them</b> before installing this.
						They can cause bugs in the new one.<br><br>

						If it is possible to USE something in this mod, a message will appear at the bottom of the
						screen showing its name.  The only thing this doesn't apply to is people.  Sometimes if you
						cannot use a usable object you may need to pick up something or destroy something first.<br><br>

						You can give commands to people (like Barney) who are following	you.
						Pressing the following keys gives the following commands:<br>
						<b>a</b> - "Attack!" (or if no enemies can be seen: "Try and find something to attack.")<br>
						<b>b</b> - "Behind you!"<br>
						<b>c</b> - "Come here!"<br>
						<b>g</b> - "Get down!"<br>
						<b>o</b> - "get the hell Out of my way!"<br>
						<b>r</b> - "Retreat!"<br>
						<b>s</b> - "lay down Surpressing fire!"<br>
						They won't always obey you, for example if they are too busy fighting or something.  You can edit the key
						configuration in the controls menu.<br><br>

						MP3s and fog effects are featured in some places.  These cause some peoples computers to crash (fog only works
						in OpenGL mode) so they can be turned off by typing "fog 0" or "mp3 0" in the console, or turned on by typing
						"fog 1" and "mp3 1".  You can also do this by editing the file <b>hoeconfig.cfg</b> in your "Evil" directory
						and setting them there.  <i>The default for fog is OFF, the default for MP3 is ON</i>.<br>

							<b>Village of the Damned</b><br><br>

							<i>How to Play</i> : Go to the Hazard Course option in the opening menu.<br><br>

							<i>Plot</i> : On the way back from a routine patrol, you and your men find yourselves hopelessly and
							inexplicably lost.  After trekking for days through the jungle with no sign of civilisation, plagued by
							mosquitos and traps left by the Viet Cong, you are close to exhaustion when suddenly you hear an unearthly
							moaning sound from the trees up ahead.  After advancing cautiously for another few hundred feet the jungle
							opens up into an unexpected clearing.<br><br>

							You've heard about this place.  According to the legends, no one has ever gotten out of here alive.  Everyone
							thought it was just a myth but now there's no mistaking where you are.  You have stumbled upon...
							THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED!!!!!!!!! MUWHAHAHAHAHAH!!!<br><br>

							<i>Objectives</i> : Find all the weapons, kill everyone!<br><br>

							There are a <i>lot</i> of monsters on this level, but then there are also a	lot of guns.<br>
							- Watch out for any booby traps.<br>
							- Try completing it without saving.<br>
							- The rmf file is included in this release (in Evil\maps), so you can change the locations of monsters,
							weapons, etc. if you want (see below).<br>

						<b>Making your own Heart of Evil levels</b><br><br>

						If you make any Heart of Evil levels that you want to release to the wider world then we can help by hosting them
						on the website, or at least linking them, so <a href="mailto:foolish_mortal@hotmail.com">email</a> me.
						Below is a guide to the new entities:<br><br>

						<b>Ambient entities</b><br>
						<br>
						<i>ambient_mp3</i> : Plays an mp3 file, which must be in the sound/Evil/mp3s directory (and not in a pak file).
						Some peoples computers crash when playing mp3s in Half-Life, for this reason you can turn them off by typing
						"mp3 0" in the console (or "mp3 1" to turn them on), or by editing the file hoeconfig.cfg (in your Evil directory)
						using notepad and setting it there.<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<b>Environment entities</b><br>
						<br>
						<i>env_bush</i> : Bush, a sprite model.  Makes a rustling sound if you touch it.  Sheds leaves if blown up or
						shot.<br>
						<br>
						<i>env_fog</i> : Fog.  Only works with OpenGL!  For this reason fog is turned off by default, to turn it on
						you have to type "fog 1" in the console (or "fog 0" to turn it off), or open the file hoeconfig.cfg (in your
						Evil directory) using notepad and set it there.<br>
						<br>
						<i>env_palm</i> : Palm tree, comes in three different sizes.  Can be blown up, if you like that sort of thing.<br>
						<br>
						<i>env_rain</i> :
						NB - env_rains have been superceded by env_rainarea, so use that instead!<br>
						You can place these in worldcraft and they fire raindrops towards the ground roughly underneath them.  It's
						best to place them in a grid, each about 128 or 256 units apart.  The 'Max Dist from Player' field is for
						optimisation - you don't want too many raindrops on the screen all at once as it uses up the epoly and the
						temporary entities, so if they are over a certain distance from the player (default 1500) they don't work.
						If you set this distance very small, and the frequency very high, it will look like a tiny localised rainstorm
						is moving above your head, like in cartoons.<br>
						Model, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						<br>
						<i>env_rainarea</i> :
						Fires raindrops at the ground in a square area around the player (you don't want them firing when you're not
						around, it just eats up memory).  You can set the maximum distance from player, the frequency with which it
						fires them, and the number of raindrops per 256 unit square area that are fired each time.  Note that the drops
						are fired from the top of the <i>bounding box</i> of the entity, so there's no point in making this one any
						interesting shapes as it'll just use the rectangle around them.<br>
						Model, Code by Nathan Ruck, with help from Laurie Cheers, Spirit of Half-Life mod.<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<b>Items</b><br>
						<br>
						<i>item_healthkit</i> :
						You can change the body of this to be NVA or US.<br>
						Models by Chris Kane.<br>
						<br>
						<i>item_helmet</i> :
						Replaces item_battery.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane.<br>
						<br>
						<i>item_flakjacket</i> :
						Replaces the wall-mounted func_recharges.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane.<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<b>Monsters</b><br><br>

						<i>monster_alien_slave</i> :
						Now with a blue color scheme instead of green!<br>
						Skin by Daniel Pickford, adapted from Valve's.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_barney</i> :
						As with Valve's but with a new skin.  Now carries a Colt 1911A1, and can throw grenades.<br>
						Skin and code by Nathan Ruck<br>
						Voice acting by Carleton Falzone (Wintermute)<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_bullsquid</i> :
						Is green instead of yellow: more suited to a jungle environment.<br>
						Skin by Daniel Pickford, adapted from Valve's.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_charlie</i> :
						Viet Cong / NVA trooper.  Carries an AK47 or an RPG7.  Can operate in squads - this means they will co-ordinate
						their efforts a bit more.  Has the option to carry grenades.<br>
						Model, Vietnamese voice acting by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						English voice acting by Travis Torrens<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_charlie_dead</i> : Dead charlie, in various poses.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_charlie_repel</i> : Repelling Charlie.  Has to be triggered to appear.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_chumtoad</i> : A harmless purple thing.  Some of the other monsters like to eat them.
						If you step on him, he goes 'squeak' and dies.<br>
						Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_huey</i> :
						Huey helicopter.  Has two forward facing miniguns which make a lot of noise but rarely hit anything, but there
						are also various option extras: rockets, a nose-mounted grenade launcher, a passenger, and the ability to drop
						troops.  The rockets are like the Apache's, and have the same limitations, ie they don't fire unless you're
						right in front of the damn thing, which never happens since it's a helicopter and it flies *above* you.  The
						grenade launcher fires lots of those 40mm grenades, eats up memory and causes a massive slow-down, I don't
						recommend using it where r_speeds are already high.  The passenger fires an M60 down at you.  He adds about
						800 to the epoly, which is already about 1200 or something, so again be careful with this.  Like the Osprey it
						can drop soldiers to replace dead ones of the same type.  You can set the number allowed to drop at one time.
						In order to make it drop them, you have to use a path_corner entity as you would to make any helicopter fly
						around and set the "New Train Speed" to 0, when it reaches that point it will stop and drop troops if necessary,
						if it is not 0 then it won't.  You can set the Passenger type to be Grunts, Friendly Grunts and MikeForces.
						This is the type of monster that will appear as the passenger with the m60 and will be dropped.  For the last
						two the Helicopter is friendly to you and shoots at your enemies.  The friendly grunts are just
						monster_human_grunts with the Friendly tag enabled.  Medics from the appropriate side will be interspersed
						randomly among them.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane</br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck, adapted from Valve's.</br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_kophyaeger</i> : A tiny, fast dinosaur-like monster, attacks by running and jumping at you.  Can
						operate in squads.  Some of the larger monsters prey on them.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						Sounds by Daniel Pickford.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_kophyaeger_adult</i> : A big adult version of the kophyaeger.  They prey on smaller monsters,
						including the kophyaeger, and will attack other large predators.  They can also operate in squads
						but unlike the kophyaeger rival squads will attack each other. <br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_kurtz</i> : Colonel Kurtz.  No AI - just stands around looking gormless unless given scripts.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_gorilla</i> : A big zombie gorilla, imported from the jungles of Africa by the Army for nefarious
						scientific testing purposes.  They prey on smaller monsters, and will attack other large predators including
						other gorillas.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						Sounds by Daniel Pickford.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_human_grunt</i> :
						This guy now has an entirely new body, which is an authentic Vietnam period grunt uniform.  He carries
						an M16, Remington 870, or M79 grenade launcher.  Has the option to carry handgrenades.  The M79 is a bit
						problematic because he can't fire at close range (without killing himself).  In real life he would have had a
						Colt 1911 or something for such situations but that would require a whole lot more code and animation
						than I feel up to making right now.  So if you're too close he either runs away or if he can't do that, runs
						up to you and attempts to kick you inna nuts.<br>
						You can set this guy to be on your side with the 'Friendly' tag.  If you shoot him his squad mates will
						attack you.  He won't follow you as the MikeForces or Barney does though.  If he is not "friendly" and his
						body tag is set to random then he will sometimes have an evil bloody face.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane<br>
						Animations, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						Voice acting by Daniel Pickford.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_hgrunt_dead</i> : Dead grunt, in various poses.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_grunt_repel</i> : As above, but with a rope.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_human_grunt_medic</i> : Medic for the monster_human_grunt, carries a Colt 1911 pistol.  Behaves
						the same as a grunt except that he will heal people next to him, including the player.  If he is in a squad
						then members of the squad can call him over to heal them.  In theory at least.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_grunt_medic_repel</i> : As above, but with a rope.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_mikeforce</i> :
						Friendly American guy in a tiger skin uniform, carries an M16, Remington 870 or M60.
						You can get him to follow you around.  Has the option to carry grenades.  Ticking
						Pre-Disaster stops him from following you and makes him use different idle chatter wavs, as in episode a.
						Can operate in squads - this means they will co-ordinate their efforts a bit more.<br>
						Model and voice acting by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_mikeforce_dead</i> : Dead MikeForce, in various poses.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_mikeforce_repel</i> : Repelling MikeForce.  Has to be triggered to appear.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_mikeforce_medic</i> : A friendly medic, carrying a Colt 1911.  Behaves the same as a MikeForce
						except that he will heal people next to him, including the player.  If he is in a squad then members of the
						squad can call him over to heal them.  In theory at least.<br>
						Model and voice acting by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_mikeforce_medic_repel</i> : Repelling MikeForce Medic.  Has to be triggered to appear.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_peasant</i> :
						Vietnamese peasant.  You can set it to be male or female.  Try not to accidentally massacre these guys -
						after all they're the people you're here to save.  This is equivalent to the old monster_scientists - but please
						don't use the monster_scientists, use the monster_peasant instead.<br>
						Model and code by Nathan Ruck, adapted from Valve's.<br>
						Male voice acting by either Travis Torrens, Mark Ferland, or Dwayne Antila.<br>
						Female voice acting by Anita Gillett<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_peasant_dead</i> : Dead peasant.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_scientist</i> : Don't use this - see above<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_superzombie</i> :
						Ultra-powerful, useful as an end-of-level boss.  As strong, slow and stupid as a zombie, but carries an M16, M60,
						Remington 870 or an RPG7.  Really only one weapon can stand against this guy: the chainsaw!  Muwahahaha!  If you
						chop off his head then he will not die instantly but slowly bleeds to death.  They prey on smaller monsters,
						and will attack other large predators including other superzombies.<br>
						Model, voice acting by Chris Kane<br>
						Animation, Code by Nathan Ruck, adapted from Valve's.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monster_sog</i> : An evil stealth guy with a sniper rifle and the ability to disappear at will.  Can operate
						in squads - this means they will co-ordinate their efforts a bit more.  Has the option to carry grenades.<br>
						Model by Chris Kane<br>
						Animations, Code by Nathan Ruck.<br>
						Voice acting by Daniel Pickford.<br>
						<br>
						<i>monster_sog_repel</i> : Repelling SOG, has to be triggered to appear.<br>
						<br>

						<i>monstermaker</i> : This entity has been altered a bit to add a child target - the entity the monster will
						target as soon as it is spawned (useful for hueys) and Trigger Target and Condition flags which will be copied
						to the created monster<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<b>Triggers</b><br>
						<br>
						<i>trigger_monsterAI</i> : When activated this means that monster AI will work in this area even if the player
						is not there.  Normally monsters only run their AI procedure when the player is in the area or if they have
						set an enemy (which they could only have done when the player was there) <i>but not if a camera is in the area</i>.
						So this entity is useful if you are using cameras, as in the bunkers in episode e.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
